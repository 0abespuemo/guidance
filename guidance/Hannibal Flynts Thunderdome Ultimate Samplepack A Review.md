## History and Culture of Gabber
 
Gabber is not only a style of music, but also a subculture that emerged in the Netherlands in the early 1990s. Gabber is derived from the Dutch slang word for "friend", and it reflects the sense of belonging and identity that the fans of this music shared. Gabber was influenced by acid house, techno and new beat, but it developed its own distinctive sound and aesthetics, characterized by fast tempos, distorted kick drums, aggressive vocals and dark themes.
 
Gabber was born as an underground and anti-establishment movement, with small and illegal raves held in empty warehouses, basements and tunnels. [^3^] Some of the influential labels and artists that shaped the scene were Rotterdam Records (founded by DJ Paul Elstak), Mokum Records (based in Amsterdam), Industrial Strength Records (created by Lenny Dee in New York), Marc Acardipane (who produced the first hardcore track "We Have Arrived" under the name Mescalinum United), The Prophet, and Rotterdam Termination Source. [^1^]
 
Gabber became a massive phenomenon in the Netherlands in the mid-1990s, with large-scale events such as Thunderdome (organized by ID&T) and Mysteryland (held by ID&T and UDC) attracting thousands of ravers from all over the country and beyond. Gabber also spread across Europe and the world, finding a home with the rave communities in countries such as the UK, Spain, Italy, USA, and Australia. [^1^] Gabber became part of mainstream Dutch culture, influencing fashion, media, art and language.
 
However, by the late 1990s, gabber started to decline in popularity and quality, as it became oversaturated, commercialized and diluted by other genres such as happy hardcore and hardstyle. Many gabbers felt disillusioned and betrayed by the scene, and moved on to other styles of music or left the rave culture altogether. By the turn of the millennium, gabber was almost extinct in the Netherlands. [^2^]
 
Despite its downfall, gabber never completely disappeared. A die-hard few kept the sound and culture alive, producing new tracks, organizing parties and supporting new generations of gabbers. In recent years, gabber has seen a major resurgence in the Netherlands and abroad, with new labels, artists and events revitalizing the scene. Gabber has also gained recognition and respect as a significant part of Dutch musical heritage and youth culture. In 2017, Thunderdome celebrated 25 years of hardcore at the Jaarbeurs congress centre in Utrecht. [^1^]
