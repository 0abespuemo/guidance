       "  'ai_text': \"This problem is asking us to find the shortest possible binary string that Timur could have started with, given the final binary string he ended up with. To do this, we can use a greedy algorithm. We can start from the leftmost character of the final string and work our way right. For each character, we check if the character to its left is the opposite of the character we are currently looking at. If it is, then we can assume that Timur added the two characters to the string when he was constructing it. We can then remove these two characters from the string and continue the process. \\n\\nFor example, in the first test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $\\\\texttt{0}$, and he performed the following operation: $\\\\texttt{0} \\\\to \\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{1}}\\\\texttt{0}\\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{0}}$. In the second test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $\\\\texttt{11}$, and he performed the following operation: $\\\\texttt{11} \\\\to \\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{0}}\\\\texttt{11}\\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{1}}$. In the third test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $\\\\texttt{10101}$, and he didn't perform any operations. In the fourth test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is the empty string (which we denote by $\\\\varepsilon$), and he performed the following operations: $\\\\varepsilon \\\\to \\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{1}}\\\\texttt{}\\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{0}} \\\\to \\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{0}}\\\\texttt{10}\\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{1}} \\\\to \\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{1}}\\\\texttt{0101}\\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{0}}$. In the fifth test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is $\\\\texttt{101}$, and he performed the following operations: $\\\\texttt{101} \\\\to \\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{0}}\\\\texttt{101}\\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{1}} \\\\to \\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{1}}\\\\texttt{01011}\\\\color{red}{\\\\texttt{0}}$.\\n\\nBelow is the code to solve this problem:\\n\\n```python\\n# Read the number of test cases\\nt = int(input())\\n\\n# Iterate over the test cases\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    # Read the length of the final string\\n    n = int(input())\\n    # Read the final string\\n    s = input()\\n    # Initialize the length of the shortest possible string\\n    shortest_length = 0\\n    # Iterate over the characters in the final string\\n    for i in range(1, n):\\n        # Check if the current character is the opposite of the character to its left\\n        if s[i] != s[i-1]:\\n            # If so, increment the length of the shortest possible string\\n            shortest_length += 2\\n    # Print the length of the shortest possible string\\n    print(shortest_length)\\n```\\n\\nInputs to run:\\n```inputs\\n9\\n3\\n100\\n4\\n0111\\n5\\n10101\\n6\\n101010\\n7\\n1010110\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n10\\n2\\n11\\n10\\n1011011010\\n```<|im_end|>\"}]"
