- A new replay training tool that helps you improve your chess skills by playing through selected games and answering questions about the moves and ideas.
- A new similarity search function that shows you all games with similar pawn structures, sacrifice patterns, endgame positions, etc.
- A new automatic analysis function that annotates your games with commentary, variations, diagrams, and evaluation profile.
- A new cloud analysis function that allows you to analyze positions simultaneously with several engines from different computers running in parallel.
- A new deep analysis function that generates an analysis tree that changes dynamically, as with time weaker variations are dropped.

ChessBase 15.14 also comes with a huge database of more than 7.6 million games from 1560 to 2018, of which 72,000 are annotated by top players. The database also includes ChessBase opening classification with more than 100,000 key positions, direct access to players, tournaments, middlegame themes, endgames, and more.
 
If you are looking for a comprehensive and user-friendly chess database program that will help you study, train, and enjoy chess at a higher level, ChessBase 15.14 with Database 2019 is a great choice.

Another feature of ChessBase 15.14 that deserves attention is the improved search mask, which allows you to find games and positions according to various criteria, such as tactical motifs, material distribution, manoeuvres, endgames, and more. You can also combine different criteria to narrow down your search results. For example, you can look for games where a knight fork occurred in a rook endgame, or where a queen sacrifice led to checkmate.
 
ChessBase 15.14 also gives you easy access to live annotated games from top tournaments and events. You can follow the games in real time with commentary by grandmasters and computer evaluations. You can also replay the games later with the annotations stored in your database. This is a great way to keep up with the latest developments and trends in chess.
 
Finally, ChessBase 15.14 lets you create stunning 3D chess movies with raytracing technology. Raytracing is a technique that simulates realistic lighting and shadows, making the chess pieces and boards look more lifelike and appealing. You can choose from different styles and themes, and export your movies as MP4 files that you can share on social media or other platforms.
